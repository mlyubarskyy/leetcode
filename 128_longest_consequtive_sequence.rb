# Time complexity : O(n)

# Although the time complexity appears to be quadratic due to the while loop
# nested within the for loop, closer inspection reveals it to be linear.
# Because the while loop is reached only when currentNum marks the beginning
# of a sequence (i.e. currentNum-1 is not present in nums), the while loop can
# only run for nn iterations throughout the entire runtime of the algorithm.
# This means that despite looking like O(n \cdot n)O(nâ‹…n) complexity, the nested
# loops actually run in O(n + n) = O(n)O(n+n)=O(n) time. All other computations
# occur in constant time, so the overall runtime is linear.

# Space complexity : O(n).

# In order to set up O(1) containment lookups, we allocate linear space for a
# hash table to store the O(n) numbers in nums. Other than that, the space
# complexity is identical to that of the brute force solution.
